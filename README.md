"# ksb-cat-adoption" 

This is a simple app I created for the cats rescue foundation, which I am currently helping.
It's goal was to help the potential homes in choosing the right cat, according to their needs and expectations;

After the foundation split in two separate ones, I had to remake the app and change some of the solutions. Although they may not be the best, I plan to work on them in the future, to make the adoption quiz as helpful as possible.

Please note that I still need to make some cosmetic changes in SCSS so that the view looks good in the horizontal position on phones and on very big devices.
Thank you for understanding.
